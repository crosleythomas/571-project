# Feed-forward network
#	Input: m * h * w * c -- frames * height * width * channels
		Concatenated number of frames back 

# Multiple convolutional layers (with non-linearity)
# Fully Connected layer (with non-linearity)

# Multiplicative layer between output of fully connected layer (h_t^{encoded}) and the action (a_t)
	# This is where action and encoded feature vector branches meet
	# W^{enc} * h^{end} in one branch
	# W^{a} * a in the other branch
	# W^{dec} * (Point-wise product of the two)
	# Gives us h_t^{dec}

# Reshape h^{dec} to for ma 3D feature map

# Multiple deconvolution layers (with non-linearity)
# Final deconvolution layer (without non-linearity)
